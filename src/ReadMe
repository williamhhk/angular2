How do we built an application?

1) Redux
2) Angular for rendering engine.
3) Redux to handle logic layer and data layer.

Motivation
----------
1) Single Source of Truth
2) SoC  (seperate logic from data)
3) Scalable by having things react to events as opposed to caller dictating actions
4) Reduce Complexity of Mental Map by seperation of components
5) Create a coherent framework
6) Uni-directional Data Flow
