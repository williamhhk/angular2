How do we built an application?

1) Redux
2) Angular for rendering engine.
3) Redux to handle logic layer and data layer.

Motivation
----------
1) Single Source of Truth
2) SoC  (seperate logic from data)
3) Scalable by having things react to events as opposed to caller dictating actions
4) Reduce Complexity of Mental Map by seperation of components
5) Create a coherent framework
6) Uni-directional Data Flow


Redux DevTools

https://github.com/ngrx

karma , debug unit test in the browser as they are running.
debugger;


Defining thing using arrow function give different binding behavior.
=>

Older javascript function does not know about =>, so it bind thing differently.

Dispatch

Make the component react to the data.


git push -u origin master

Once we hook up Redux, no longer need services anymore.
